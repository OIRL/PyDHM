## PyDHM Python library for numerical reconstructions of holograms 

PyDHM is a python library to mainly obtain numerical reconstructions for holograms in digital holography and digital holography microscopic.  Besides, PyDHM can be used to numerical propagation of scalar wave fields.

PyDHM was developed by the cooperation of OIRL research group form The University of Memphis and the EAFIT university.  

PyDHM contains two main packages, propagation approaches PyDHM.propagation and DHM implementations PyDHM.Implementations. Below an explanation of each package. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/OIRL/PyDHM/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
